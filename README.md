It contains a simple implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game in C programming language. The code allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid until one player wins by getting three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal, or the game ends in a draw if there are no more spaces left. The repository includes the main C file with the game logic, including functions for checking win conditions, displaying the game board, and marking the board with player moves.
